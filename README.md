# Animal-Quiz-Game

The aim of this project is to create a user-friendly
interactive game for young children using various design techniques such as design patterns. The goal
of this application is to teach primary school children some aspect of science. As the users of this game
are young the game is simple and easy to use yet fun and colourful that promotes re-playability and in
turn helps the children to learn.

The idea of the applicationis that animals and their characteristics can be discussed in class and then
the application can be used to test their knowledge. The solution is a quiz-based application that shows
an image of an animal along with a question and multiple-choice answers. The questions start of easy
and progressively get harder. Animals are displayed onscreen at random after the user choses an answer
to the question displayed on screen.

The design patterns used in this application are MVC (Model, View Controller) and Factory pattern.
By using good design choices, it is intended the application not only reaches the goal but also has the
opportunity to be scaled further.
